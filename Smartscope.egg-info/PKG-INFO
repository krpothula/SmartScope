# Welcome to SmartScope

For information about installation and usage, please visit the official [documentation website](https://docs.smartscope.org)


# Citing SmartScope

[Bouvette, Huang et al. eLife 2022;11:e80047](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.80047)

# Docker basic installation

To avoid file permission issues, you should perform these steps as the user that will run the smartscope software.

### 1. Download the minimal configuration files.

```ShellSession
wget docs.smartscope.org/downloads/SmartScopeInstallation.tar.gz --no-check-certificate
tar -xvf SmartScopeInstallation.tar.gz 
cd SmartScope
```

The directory contains 5 files that can be divided in 3 categories:

Docker files:

- `docker-compose.yml`: Main file for the docker environment. Should not need to be changed.
- `smartscope.yml`: Simpler version of the docker-compose.yml to add additional settings. This one needs to be changed.

Configuration:

- `database.conf`: Contains the configuration for the database connections to share between smartscope and the database.
- `smartscope.conf`: Contains the configuration that is unique to smartscope.

Script:

- `smartscope.sh`: Used to start and stop the smartsocpe software.


### 2. Create a directory on your SerialEM computer where SmartScope will save data and a storage area for smartscope.

```ShellSession
mkdir /mnt/serialemComputer/smartscope
mkdir /mnt/nas/smartscope
```


### 3. Edit the `smartscope.yml` file to add your microscope path and the paths that you just created.

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
smartscope:
    image: ghcr.io/niehs/smartscope:0.8-rc.2  
    user: ${UID}:${GID}
    volumes: 
    # - /home/ubuntu/SmartScope/:/opt/smartscope/
    ######## ADD YOUR MAIN DATA LOCATION ##########
    - /mnt/nas/smartscope/:/mnt/data/
    # Example:
    # - /nfs/data/:/mnt/data/
    ######## ADD YOUR MICROSCOPES #########
    # The synthax from the microscope volumes is as follows:
    # - /path/to/where/serialem/will/write/files/:/mnt/your_scope_name_here/
    - /mnt/serialemComputer/smartscope/:/mnt/myscope1/
    # Example:
    # - /mnt/gatan_Raid_X/smartscope/:/mnt/arctica/
```

*Note You can add multiple microscopes to the same SmartScope installation. Simply add an additional entry to the volumes section.*

### 4. *(Optional)* Edit the configuration files to your needs.

Detailed information about the environment variables can be found in the official documentation

### 5. Start SmartScope

The first start will download all the container images and is expected to last a few minutes.

```ShellSession
./smartscope.sh start

#Outputs should look like this
Starting smartscope
[+] Running 5/5
⠿ Network installation_smartscopenet  Created      0.0s
⠿ Container installation-cache-1      Started      0.7s
⠿ Container smartscope-db             Started      0.6s

⠿ Container installation-nginx-1      Started      1.4s
```

### 6. Log in to the web interface with the initial admin account.

You should now be able to access the smartscope interface at [http://localhost:48000](http://localhost:48000/).

The initial account is `admin` with password `smartscope`. 

### 7. The installation is done!
    
There is a few more set up steps to do in SerialEM and in the web portal to get up and running.
