description: |
  Hole finder that uses the YOLO architecture to identify the holes at the medium mag (View).
  Has a built-in classifier to sort out the dark contamination and partial holes that are often labeled as holes on carbon mesh grids.
  Will also find the lattice parameters of the grid and create targets from that lattice.
